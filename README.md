# Vue 3 + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (previously Volar) and disable Vetur

## Getting Started


First walk in to the folder compositionAPI:

```bash
cd compositionAPI/
```

After, install the dependences:

```bash
npm install
```
Finally run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.

This project is about my studying in vuejs 3 with composition API.
